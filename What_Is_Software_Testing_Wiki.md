**What is Software Testing?**

Software testing is a method to check and verify that a software is
working bug-free, according to the application, and with full technical
compliance as stated by the design and development department. It
assesses the functionality of the software program. The aim of the
software testing is to identify the errors, faults, or missing
requirements in comparison with the actual user requirements.

Software testing can be divided in two parts:

1.  Verification: Are we building the product right?

2.  Validation: Are we building the right product?

**Why Software Testing is Necessary?**

Even though software testing costs a significant amount of money, still
the testing of a new software is highly required to be safe from
monetary loss in future because of a bug. Companies can save millions
per year if they have good testing and quality assurance techniques.

Due to the following advantages, software testing is important,

-   Defects can be identified early

-   Improvement in the quality of the software

-   Increased customer satisfaction

-   Helps with scalability

-   Saves time and money

Early testing makes the software bug free before it is launched in the
market for users. The sooner development team gets the feedback, the
sooner they address the issues such as,

-   Architectural flaws

-   Poor Design decisions

-   Incorrect functionality

-   Security Vulnerabilities

-   Scalability issues

**Type of software testing**

Software testing can broadly be classified into 3 types.

1.  **Functional Testing:** It is the type of software testing which
    validates the system against the functional requirements. Functional
    testing usually describes what the system does. Since the functional
    testing is a type of black-box testing, the test can be performed
    without having the knowledge of Internal working of the system. The
    types of Functional testing are Unit testing, Integration Testing,
    and System testing.

2.  **Non-functional Testing:** It is a type of software testing that
    checks the non-functional requirements like performance,
    scalability, portability, stress, etc.

3.  **Maintenance Testing:** It is the process of changing, modifying,
    and updating software according to the customer's need. It involves
    regressive testing which verifies that the recent change in code has
    not adversely affected the other developed parts of the code.

Software testing can further be classified into 2 more way of testing:

1.  **Manual Testing:** It includes testing software manually without
    using any automated tool or script. Here the tester acts as an end
    user in order to test the software functionality and reliability.
    Test engineer uses test cases, test plans, or test scenarios to
    ensure the completeness in detecting a bug or any unexpected
    behavior of the software.

2.  **Automation Testing:** It is also known as test automation, in
    which the tester used a script or any other testing software to test
    the developed software. It allows execution of repetitive tasks
    without an intervention from manual tester. Automation testing is
    timesaving as it is executed by tools or scripts.

**Different Types of Software Test Techniques**

Software testing techniques can majorly be classified into,

1.  **Back-box testing:** It is a testing approach where the tester does
    > not need to know the internal working of the code for the software
    > development. The tester just needs to have knowledge of how the
    > software should perform by giving a particular command.

2.  **White-box testing:** In contrast to Black-box testing, this
    testing approach required the tester to have access and knowledge of
    source code and its internal working to test the software
    functionality according to the given specification.

There is one more technique for software testing which is a hybrid model
of black and white box testing. This method is known as [Grey-box
testing]{.underline}, where the tester needs to know the implementation
of source code but need not to be an expert in coding.

**Different Levels of Software Testing**

Software level testing can be classified into 4 levels,

1.  **Unit Testing:** It is the process where the Individual function of
    software is tested to check if all functions are working as per the
    required classifications or not.

2.  **Integration Testing:** It is a level of testing which is performed
    once the individual units are combined as a group. The aim of this
    testing is to check the error in Integration of the unit functions.

3.  **System Testing:** It is a level of testing where the complete
    system(software) is tested to check its working and to find out any
    bugs in the source code.

4.  **Acceptance Testing:** This level of testing is done to check the
    software\'s acceptability. The aim of this test level is to
    determine whether the software is as per the business standard, and
    if it is ready to be deployed in the market.
