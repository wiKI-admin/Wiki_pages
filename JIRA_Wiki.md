**Relating JIRA to IBM DOORS**

IBM DOORS, on the other hand, is a dedicated requirement management tool
with a strong focus on capturing, managing, and tracing requirements
throughout project lifecycle. While JIRA and DOORS have different
purposes, they can work together in harmony.

Here is how they can complement each other:

  - DOORS can be used to capture and manage the project’s requirements.
    These requirements can then be linked to JIRA issues, ensuring a
    tight integration between the two tools.

  - By linking requirements in DOORS to JIRA issues, you establish
    traceability, making it easy to track how requirements are being
    implemented and tested within JIRA environment.

  - JIRA’s collaborative feature comes in handy when team needs to
    discuss, assign, or resolve issues related to requirements from
    DOORS.

  - Custom workflows in JIRA can be designed to incorporate stages
    related to requirements analysis, ensuing that the development
    process aligns with the defined requirements.

To integrate JIRA with IBM DOORS, you can use connectors or custom
scripts. The JIRA REST API is often used to establish the connection
between JIRA and other tools, Including IBM DOORS.
