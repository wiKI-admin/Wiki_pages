• Verify that parentheses and square brackets are used correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>☐</td>
<td><p><strong>Each statement shall start on a new line:</strong><br />
Unacceptable:<br />
if(dValue != dOtherValue) {bValuesSame = false;}<br />
Acceptable:<br />
If(dValue == dOtherValue){<br />
bValuesSame = true;<br />
}</p>
<p>The opening brace should be on the same line as the if statement, followed by a newline and proper indentation for the code block inside.</p></td>

<td> ☐</td>
<td><p><strong>Compilation errors:</strong><br />
• Check for missing or incorrect header file inclusions.<br />

<td> ☐</td>
<td><strong>Initialization and assignment:</strong><br />
⦁ Verify that all variables are properly initialized before use.<br />
⦁ Check for accidental assignment (=) instead of equality comparison (==).<br />
⦁ Ensure that pointers are initialized to valid memory addresses.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td> ☐</td>

⦁ Check for proper allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory using new and delete or new[] and delete[].<br />
⦁ Avoid memory leaks by ensuring all allocated memory is properly released.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td> ☐</td>
<td><strong>Array handling:</strong><br />
⦁ Verify that array indices are within bounds to avoid out-of-bounds access.<br />
⦁ Ensure that multidimensional arrays are declared and accessed correctly.</td>

<td> ☐</td>
<td><strong>Logic and control flow</strong>:<br />
⦁ Check for logical errors in conditional statements, loops, and switch statements.<br />
⦁ Verify that loops have proper termination conditions to avoid infinite loops.<br />
⦁ Ensure that break statements are used correctly in switch statements.</td>
</tr>

<td> ☐</td>
<td><p><strong>Function usage:</strong><br />
⦁ Verify that function calls have the correct number and type of arguments.<br />
⦁ Check for missing return statements in non-void functions.<br />
⦁ Ensure that function prototypes and definitions match.</p>
<p>⦁ A function shall have a single point of exit at the end of the function.</p>
<p>⦁ All exits paths from a function with non-void return type have an explicit return statement with an expression.</p></td>
</tr>

<td> ☐</td>
<td><strong>Const correctness:</strong><br />
⦁ Check for missing or incorrect usage of the const keyword for variables and function parameters.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>☐</td>
<td><p><strong>The operands of a logical &amp;&amp; or || shall be primary expressions.<br />
</strong>Do not allow usage of ^ (XOR) operand in logical operations.</p>
<p>Primary expressions are either a single identifier, or a constant, or a parenthesized expression. The effect of this rule is to require that if an operand is other than a single identifier or constant then it must be parenthesized.<br />
<em>Unacceptable:</em><br />
if (x == 0 &amp;&amp; ishigh);<br />
if (x || y &amp;&amp; z);<br />

<p>⦁ Avoid excessive coupling between classes.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td> ☐</td>
<td><p><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong></p>
<p>⦁ Include thorough unit tests for your code.</p>
<p>⦁ Use a debugger to identify and fix issues.</p>
<p>⦁ Consider using assertions to verify assumptions and catch potential bugs.</p>
<p>⦁ Document known limitations or known issues in your code.</p></td>

<td> ☐</td>
<td><p><strong>Version Control and Documentation:</strong></p>
<p>⦁ Utilize a version control system to track changes and collaborate with others.</p>
<p>⦁ Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your code, including API documentation if applicable.</p>
<p>⦁ Include code comments or docstrings to explain complex algorithms or important concepts</p></td>
