**HOW TO CHECK IF THE TEST-SESSION IS UP AND RUNNING**

All applications implement an idle or inactivity timeout for sessions.
This timeout defines the amount of time a session will remain active in
case there is no activity by the user, closing and invalidating the
session. The idle timeout limits the chances that an attacker has to
guess and use a valid session ID from another user, and under certain
circumstances could protect the on going session in configuration from
reuse.

By checking the current status of the session configuration we can check
if the session is still running (green light).

Sometimes during the execution of very long Alert tests the session
configurator looses the connection to the session. If this occurs the
green bar above the panels and the components get red.

**How To Drop Execution**

Dropping execution is a precise process, demanding meticulous planning
and seamless coordination. In this process, we search into the essential
steps, from creating a valid standard operating procedure or control
plan to safely powering up the system, loading the payload, executing
the drop, confirming its success, and concluding by depowering the
system.
