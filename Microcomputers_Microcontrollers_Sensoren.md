## Microcomputers

A microcomputer is a compact computer built on a single PCB (Printed
Circuit Board), encompassing essential components like a CPU, RAM, and
WiFi module. These boards often include integrated ports for connecting
peripherals. Microcomputers, such as the Raspberry Pi, are known for
their active communities which offer support for various issues and
projects. However, they typically lack real-time computational
capabilities, except in specific models.

### Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a versatile microcomputer with a range of
applications. Its limitations include the inability to natively read or
generate analog signals, necessitating external modules like ADCs or
DACs. By clustering multiple units, the Raspberry Pi's computational
capacity can be enhanced, making it suitable for projects like web
hosting and servers. This scalability and affordability make it ideal
for small to medium-sized projects.

### How to install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi

To install Ubuntu, download the appropriate version from the Ubuntu
website and install it on a microSD card. Ubuntu's GUI, similar to
Microsoft Windows, makes the installation process straightforward.
However, Ubuntu, being a Linux distribution, differs significantly from
Windows in terms of commands and functionalities. For detailed
instructions, visit: <https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi>

## Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are typically used for tasks involving analog-digital
and digital-analog conversions, crucial in operating sensors and
actuators like temperature sensors, motors, LEDs, and more. A
microcontroller can manage multiple sensors and actuators
simultaneously, with its capacity determined by the specific model.
Unlike microcomputers, microcontrollers are not suitable for use as
personal computers, servers, or databases.

### Arduino

Arduino benefits from a large and active community, where numerous
projects and ideas have already been implemented. Arduino programming is
done in a subset of C++, with the same syntax but additional functions
specific to Arduino hardware. The market also offers many Arduino
replicas, which are more affordable alternatives to the original models.
Arduino is widely used in robotics, control systems, and other
applications.
