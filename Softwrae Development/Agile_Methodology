**What is Agile methodology?**

Agile methodology is a project management approach which focuses on
cross functional collaboration and continuous improvements. It breaks
the projects into several phases so the team can plan, execute, and
evaluate according to that part's requirements and the cycle repeats for
each phase of the project.

Here are some of the benefits of using Agile methodology,

1.  Satisfied Customers – this method keeps customers in a loop in the
    development phase, which shows that they value the customer’s
    opinion.

2.  Improved quality – It uses an iterative approach to project
    management which means that the processes are improved each time the
    interval is repeated.

3.  Adaptability – It is responsive to change and can adapt with the
    change without much disruption.

4.  Reduced Risk – developers regularly assess the progress during each
    phase of the project which enables them to spot any obstacles
    quickly.

5.  Better Communication – Teams give priority to face-to-face meetings,
    which makes the communication smooth, and it helps to monitor the
    progress of the project.
