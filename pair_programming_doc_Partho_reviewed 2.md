# Pair-Programming

Pair-Programming is an agile software development practice where two
developers share a single workstation. One programmer acts as the driver
who writes the code. The other programmer acts as the navigator who is
looking over the code to proofread, spell check and thinking over
further steps to improve the code. The roles can be switched any time.
Pair-Programming is seen as controversial because it may improve the
quality of the code, but it also may be inconvenient and decrease
efficiency.

# Benefits of Pair-Programming

The main benefit of Pair-Programming is the advantage of two people
working together, which results in a faster solving of the problem. The
pair learns how to communicate with each other, work together and share
information. There are fewer mistakes during coding because a lot of
errors are being caught as they are being typed. The code is shorter and
tighter, which makes it easier to read. The developers learn more about
the specifics of the applications that they are working on as well as
software development in general. Pair-Programming is also safer for the
company, because more people know how the program works. If one of the
pairs leaves the company, it will not kill the project.

# Benefits compared to code reviews

It might be challenging to find a partner for code reviews because they
don’t want to learn/understand someone else’s code just for the sake of
checking its quality. Code reviews happen mostly when someone wants to
add a functionality to the code, in that case the original programmer
might not be around anymore to appreciate the feedback. Pairing reviews
the code instantly and there is no waiting till the code is finished to
review it.

# Challenges of pairing

Pair-Programming is a highly interactive practice and therefore not
something that can be forced on a team. The pair should be able to
communicate what they are working on and be equally engaged and
participative for the duration of the task. Pairing results in a 15%
slowdown for individual outputs but speeds up the process overall and
ensures a better code quality.

# How-To Pair-Programming

One programmer (driver) has control over the keyboard/mouse and actively
implements the code. The other programmer (navigator) observes the work
of the driver, detects bugs and thinks strategically about direction of
the work. They both brainstorm about problems when necessary and
periodically switch roles.

Laurie A. Williams and Robert R. Kessler explain pair programming in
their book ‘***All I Really need to Know about Pair Programming I
Learned in Kindergarten***’. The following sections are an excerpt of
this publication:

## Share everything

Both programmers work on the same artifact. They are responsible for
every aspect of the artifact and own everything.

## Play fair

One programmer drives while the navigator continuously reviews the work.
Switching roles periodically to ensure equal participation, even when
one is more experienced than the other. While the driver is thinking
about implementation, the navigator is thinking about overall simpler
design.

## Do not hit your partner

Each one keeps their partner focused on task with no possibility of
slack off while ensuring they are following the coding standards. Each
artifact is reviewed continuously as it is being produced.

## Put things back where they belong

Believe in your and your partner’s skills. Any negative thoughts in this
aspect are to be put in the trash can. Express what you know and be open
to learn from your partner when required. You need the confidence that
together as a pair, you can solve problems you could not solve alone.

## Clean up your mess

With the ‘watch over the shoulder’ technique you find out how many
defects are noticed by your partner. You can remove defects without the
natural animosity that might develop in a formal meeting as well as
characterizing defect prevention and defect removal efficiency.

## Do not take things too seriously

Ensure you work without excess ego or too little ego. Being defensive
can cause a programmer to not receive constructive criticism or to view
the criticism as mistrust. For favorable idea exchange, there should be
some healthy disagreement/debate when required.

## Say sorry when you hurt someone while moving furniture

Programmers must be able to sit side by side and sharing keyboard and
mouse while viewing the computer screen. They need to see each other to
ensure effective communication, ask each other questions and make
decisions on things such as integration issues. Programmers also benefit
from overhearing other conversations to which they can have vital
contributions.

## Disown skepticism before you start

For Pair-Programming to be successful, both partners need to understand
the value of collaboration in programming, the benefits, and the joy of
the experience. Any Skepticism in this regard needs to be stopped in the
beginning. Having one programmer, very positive and/or very experienced
in pair programming can lead the pair to become one jelled collaborative
team victoriously. The production of jelled teams is greater, the
enjoyment derived from their work is greater than what you would expect,
given the nature of the work itself and the probability of a success
goes up dramatically.

## Flush

The Pair-Programmers can work on something independently, but when they
rejoin, they must review the independent work before incorporating it or
flush and rewrite the independent work along with continuous review of
the work. Never incorporate any independent work without reviews by the
partner.

## Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you 

Pair-Programmers keep each other continuously focused on-task, which can
be very intense and mentally exhausting. Periodically take a break to
maintain the stamina for another round of programming. During the break,
is it best to disconnect form the task and approach with a freshness
when restarting.

## Live a balanced life

Communicating with others on regular basis is the key for leading a
balanced life. Informal discussions with the partner and other
programmers allow exchange of effective ideas and transfer of
information.

## Take a break from working together every afternoon

It is not necessary to work separately every afternoon, but it is
acceptable to work alone 10-15% of the time. Many programmers prefer to
do experimental prototyping, deep-concentrating problems and logical
thinking alone. It also is more efficient to write simple, well-defined
code by solitary programmer and then review it by a partner.

## Watch out for traffic hold hands and stick together

There should be no competition between the pair. Both must work together
as if the artifact is produced by a single mind. Partners need to trust
each other’s judgement and they should never blame each other for any
problems or defects.

## Be aware of the power of two brains 

When two are working together, each has their own set of knowledge and
skills. Common knowledge will enable to communicate effectively while
unique skills will allow them to contribute to accomplish their task. A
pair will come up with twice as many possible solutions than when they
would work alone. They will proceed more quickly to narrow in on the
best solution and implements that solution more quickly and with better
quality. 

# Different Pair-Programming styles

> Pair-Programming can be beneficial from a business’s perspective, but
> there are also different styles, which work best under given
> circumstances.

## Unstructured Pairing

> The unstructured pairing collaboration paradigm resolves around the
> concept of two people wanting to work together without knowing any
> techniques and figuring out by trial an error. It involves two
> checked-in minds and a single computer.

## Driver-Navigator

This paradigm derives its name from the way two travelers might
negotiate a car trip through unfamiliar territory. The driver handles
typing, navigating between files and basic implementation. The navigator
looks at broader concerns and checks for mistakes.

Driver-Navigator works well with two experts, who may trade roles. It
also works with an expert and a novice when the expert navigates.

## Backseat Navigator

This protocol looks like driver-navigator but with the navigator taking
over more of the tactical as well as strategic. Like driver-navigator,
the driver executes the mechanics of typing but his partner dictates
instructions. This might mean that the navigator tells the driver when
to create a method or open a new file.

This style works best with novice-expert pairings with the novice as
driver. It gives the novice a chance to learn by doing things the way
the expert would.

## Tour Guide

This style revolves around the concept of the driver explaining each
step he is taking to the tourist. The tourist rarely intervenes.

This works with expert driver and novice tourist, particularly in cases
of new novices. But it also can work well flipped. The novice can fail
at the problem while the expert observes and then provides feedback and
correction.

## Ping-Pong Pairing

This style takes the test-driven development from extreme programming
into account and builds upon it. The first person writes a failing test
and the second person gets it to pass. Then the second person writes a
failing test and the first person gets it to pass.

This style works well with two experts as well as the novice-experts
pairing. This might go best with the novice-novice pairing, when the
goal Is getting the novices some practice.
