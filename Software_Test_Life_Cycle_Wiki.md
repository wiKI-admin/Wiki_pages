**What is Software Test Life Cycle?**

Software Test Life Cycle (STLC) refers to a systematic testing process
that defines specific steps to be executed in a particular manner with
the aim of ensuring that the highest quality has been achieved and the
software is bug free. It consists of several steps having its own
specific objectives and deliverables. Each of these steps have
pre-defined entry and exit criteria.

It is consisting of below mentioned steps,

1.  **Requirements Analysis:** It is the first step of STLC. The quality
    assurance and testing team starts with reviewing the available
    requirements and specifications. They identify the types of tests to
    be performed. Test Automation feasibility will also be checked in
    this stage.

2.  **Test Planning:** Test planning in STLC involves a QA manager
    determining the test plan strategy to follow along with the cost and
    resource estimation. The test plan gets prepared and finalized in
    this same phase.

3.  **Test Case Development:** In this step, the testing team notes down
    the detailed test cases. The testing team also prepares the data
    required to conduct the test cases. At the end of this stage, test
    teams should have comprehensive and accurate test cases which
    provides overall coverage of the software functionality.

4.  **Test Environment Setup:** It is the vital part of STLC as in this
    step, the software and hardware conditions on which the software is
    being tested will be determined. Once the environment is deployed,
    smoke tests need to be performed to ensure that the work
    environments are working as expected with all the required
    functionalities.

5.  **Test Execution:** In this phase, testing of the software built is
    done as per the test plans and test cases prepared. Expected test
    results are compared with the actual results and the feedback is
    given to the development teams.

6.  **Test Cycle closure:** This is the final phase of the Software Test
    Life Cycle where all test related activities are completed and
    documented. This documentation includes objectives met, time taken,
    total costs, test coverage, and any defects found. The main
    objective of this stage is to ensure that all the testing-related
    activities have been performed and the software is ready for
    release.

**Advantages of Software Test Life Cycle (STLC)**

The advantages of following a systematic STLC are,

  - It can enhance the product vision

  - It maximizes the chance of getting bug free software which is fully
    in accordance with the requirements.

  - Systematic testing leads to quick bug identification and fixing.

  - Well defined goals and phases help to track project progress.
