**Software Design Process**

The software high-level requirements are refined in this process in
order to develop the software architecture and the low-level
requirements.

**Software Design Process Objectives**

It’s objectives are:

1.  Software architecture and low-level requirements are developed from
    high-level requirements

2.  Derived low-level requirements are provided to the system safety
    assessment process

**Software design process activities**

It’s inputs are:

  - Software Requirements Data, Software Development Plan and Software
    Design Standards

  - After the transition criteria have been satisfied, high-level
    requirements are used

It’s outputs are:

  - The primary output is the Design Description, which includes the
    software architecture and low-level requirements

Guidance for this process includes:

1.  Low-level requirements and software architecture developed during
    the software design process should conform to the Software Design
    Standards and be traceable, verifiable and consistent.

2.  Derived requirements should be defined and analyzed to ensure that
    higher level requirements are not compromised.

3.  Modes of failure, or the deletion of other modes could be
    introduced. The use of partitioning or other methods may alter the
    software level assignment for some components of the software. For
    those cases, additional data should be defined as derived
    requirements and provided to the system safety assessment process.

4.  Control flow and data flow should be monitored when safety-related
    requirements dictate.

5.  Responses to failure conditions should be consistent with the
    safety-related requirements.

6.  Incorrect inputs should be provided to either the system life cycle
    process, software requirements process or the software planning
    process, for clarification.
