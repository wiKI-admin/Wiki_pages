**Software Development Life Cycle**

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process involving Planning,
Creating, Testing, and Deploying any software that enables low-cost,
high-quality and in time software development with minimum risks. The
SDLC defines the phases for the whole development with each phase having
its own process and deliverables.

There are mainly six stages in this development cycle:

1.  Planning and Analysis

2.  Design

3.  Development

4.  > Testing

5.  Deployment

6.  Maintenance

**What are SDLC Models?**

SDLC models present it in an organized way to help the organization and
its developers. Different models arrange various phases in different
chronological orders to optimize the development cycle and make it more
efficient. There are several SDLC methodologies used in the industry but
a few of the widely known methodologies are described below.

1.  <span class="underline">Waterfall</span>

> It is the oldest, simplest, and most structured methodology. In this,
> the outcome of each phase depends on the result of the previous phase,
> and the chain continues like this for the rest of the phase in whole
> development process. But because of this, the method is not efficient
> when flexibility in development is required.

2.  <span class="underline">Agile</span>

> It produces an ongoing cycle with its features and the new changes
> which are being made compared to the previous version. At each
> iteration, the product is tested. This enables teams to identify and
> resolve any issues if they are present in the product which makes it
> easy to involve stakeholders and get their feedback throughout the
> development process.
> 
> The agile model is both iterative and incremental, making it a more
> efficient methodology than other process models.

3.  <span class="underline">Lean</span>

> It is inspired by lean manufacturing principles and practices. It
> makes better flow in work and develops continuous improvement culture.
> Lean production is a method that aims to reduce time within the
> production systems as well as the response time from suppliers to end
> user. In simple words, it is just like production on demand.

4.  <span class="underline">Iterative</span>

> In this method, each cycle produces an incomplete but deployable
> version of the software. With each iteration, new features will be
> added.

5.  <span class="underline">Spiral</span>

> In Spiral methodology, the development is according to the unique risk
> factors associated with the projects.

6.  <span class="underline">V-Shaped</span>

> In the V-Shaped model, verification and validation phases run in
> parallel. A system is said to be running in V-Shaped, if each phase of
> the development has an associated phase of testing.

**Why is it important?**

SDLC is important because of the various advantages it possesses for the
complete development process. Such as,

  - Standardize framework

  - Helps in Project Planning, estimating, and scheduling

  - Easy tracking and control of the project deliverables

  - Improving documentation

  - Increased visibility in development for all stakeholders involved

  - Improves client relations

  - Reduced project risks

  - Decreased project management expenses and overall cost of production
