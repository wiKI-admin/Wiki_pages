**What is Wireshark?**

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer, or an application
that captures packets from network connection, such as from your
computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given
to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.

Wireshark does three things,

1.  **Packet Capture:** Wireshark listens to a network connection in
    real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic â€“ quite possibly
    tens of thousands of packets at a time.

2.  **Filtering:** Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all this
    random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain
    just the information you need to see.

3.  **Visualizasion:** Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows
    you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also
    allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

**When Should Wireshark be Used?**

Wireshark can be used to understand how communication takes place across
a network and to analyze what went wrong when an issue in communication
arises.

Wireshark helps in:

  - Network administrators troubleshoot problems across a network

  - Security engineers examine security issues across a network

  - QA engineers verify applications

  - Developers debug protocol implementations

  - Network users learn about a specific protocol
